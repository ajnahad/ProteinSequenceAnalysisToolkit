# **Protein Sequence Analysis Toolkit**

- A Python toolkit for analyzing, comparing, and reporting on protein and DNA sequences
- Supports sequence statistics, alignments, biochemical property calculations, motif detection, and database management

## Features 
- **Sequence classes** -> represent *protein and DNA sequences* with validation and basic operations
- **Alignment** -> global and local *pairwise alignments with scoring*, identity, and similarity calculations
- **Sequence analysis** -> molecular weight, GRAVY, pI, secondary structure prediction, instability index
- **Multi-sequence comparison** -> conserved residues, distance matrices, grouping by similarity
- **Database management** -> storing, retrieving, filtering sequences; importing/exporting FASTA files
- **Reporting** -> generate formatted text reports with tables, summary statistics, and alignment results

## Python modules used
- *Biopython* v1.86
- *Levenshtein / python-Levenshtein* v0.27.3

## Requirements
- Requires Python 3.9+.
